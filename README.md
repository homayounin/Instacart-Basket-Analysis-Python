# Instacart Sales Analysis and Strategy Recommendations
# Objective
Instacart, a leading online grocery platform, operates primarily through a user-friendly app. While the company enjoys strong sales figures, there is an ongoing need to deepen their understanding of customer behavior to optimize marketing strategies. The goal of this project is to conduct an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Instacart’s sales data to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations for improved market segmentation.

# Key Questions Addressed
Peak Sales Periods: When are the busiest times and days for orders? Understanding these patterns will help the sales team strategically plan ad placements during less active periods.

High-Spending Times: Are there specific times of the day when customers tend to spend more? Identifying these periods can inform targeted product advertising strategies.

Price Groupings: Instacart offers a wide variety of products across different price points. Simplified price group classifications can enhance the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

Product Popularity: Which product categories (departments) experience the highest order frequencies? This information is crucial for prioritizing marketing and sales initiatives.

Customer Segmentation and Behavior: A detailed analysis of customer segments based on various factors such as:

Brand Loyalty: How often do customers return to Instacart? What is the distribution of loyalty among users?
Ordering Habits by Loyalty: Are there discernible differences in the ordering patterns of loyal versus less loyal customers?
Regional Differences: How do ordering habits vary by region?
Demographic Insights: What connections can be drawn between age, family status, and ordering behaviors?
Customer Profiles: How do different customer profiles influence their purchasing habits in terms of order value, frequency, and product preferences?
# Data Sources

Note: The customer dataset and the prices column were introduced for the purpose of enhancing learning within the CareerFoundry course.

# Tools and Libraries
The analysis was conducted using Python, leveraging the following libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
Matplotlib: For basic plotting and visualization.
SciPy: For statistical computations.
Warnings: To suppress unnecessary warnings during execution.
# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

Project Management: Contains the Project Brief and Data Dictionary.
Data: Divided into Original Data and Prepared Data subfolders, housing the raw data files and cleaned/processed data, respectively.
Scripts: Includes the Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Analysis: Contains the Visualizations folder, where all charts and plots used for insights are stored.
Final Report: The report, formatted in Excel, is located in the Sent to Client folder.
